## Overview

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design using Typography
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) -  Js framework  

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/) - This helped me for making a responsive layout and many more. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [fedmentor.dev](https://fedmentor.dev/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to ask for help(and actually get it!). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
